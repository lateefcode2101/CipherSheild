1.1 Check if the file is Video or Text
1.2 If (text):
1.3 	encrypt text with AES
1.4		encrypt aes key with RSA
1.5 	Send AES-encrypted cipher and encrypted key
1.6	else if (video):
2: 		Generate video chunks from input file
3: 		Fetch the receiver’s public key
4: 		Collect receiver’s attributes [Device id, System Timestamp, Process Id]
5: 		Encrypt Vc0 using
